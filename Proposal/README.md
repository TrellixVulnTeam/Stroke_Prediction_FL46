# Project Proposal 

This repo is T5 Bootcamp requirement.

# What kind of people who are likely to have stroke?

Based on some research and studies, stroke is considered as one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project is used to predict patients with high risk to get stroke depending on certain attributes. 

The project objective is predicting whether a patient will have stroke based on some given features.

## Dataset
To accomplish the purpose of project, the “Stroke Prediction Dataset” will be used which can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).

This dataset has the following attributes:
ID 
Gender 
Age
Hypertension
Ever Married
Work Type
Residence Type
Avg Glucose Level
BMI
Smoking Status
Stroke

Here is a data sample shown in the following table in ```.csv``` file:
| id   | gender | age | hypertension | heart_disease | ever_married | work_type | Residence_type | avg_glucose_level | bmi  | smoking_status  | stroke |
|------|--------|-----|--------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|------|-----------------|--------|
| 9046 | Male   | 67  | 0            | 1             | Yes          | Private   | Urban          | 228.69            | 36.6 | formerly smoked | 1      |


The most important features for this project will be identified after data modeling and evaluation.

## Tools:
Some tools will be used such as: ```sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib```

## **To Do** :
- Data will be explored with EDA phases. Then a model will be used to fit the data.
- **NOTE** : some features might be increased or changed and the model as well.
